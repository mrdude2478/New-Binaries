Info:  
Hac21 has been built for windows64 bit from source, this is a standalone static build compiled with mingw64, it's been compressed with upx packer, for smaller builds you could compile yourself on Linux using a cross compiler.  
Libhac - this has been slightly modded from the source files, it's had some new keys added for FW19.  
Hactool - this is a slightly modded version and has been updated to be able to use the new debug flags introduced in Atmosphere 1.8.0.
